# MicroDatingSimulation
A quick visual narrative style game I made for my AP review micro project.

5 questions where the player tries to win the textbook's heart.

There are a total of 6 endings and which ending is played depends on the player's correct answers.

The pictures are of BCA. 

Should be runnable with RenPy.
